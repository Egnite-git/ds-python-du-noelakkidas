There are many matrices of evolution with many open source library which follow specific approach in this Key-Phrase Extraction, for example : TF*IDF which is one of the most popularly used matric of evaluation. This is the first NLP step done on this project, to get better results its better to do various pre-processing steps such as, stop-words removal, tokenisation, stemming etc..
  - As a part of the bug listed in the ```issues``` tab, upload the python script you have written to do this automation, also upload the KeyPhrases you have extracted, in any file format.

  
- [ ] **Part 3.2: Understanding Output**

  With the list of Key-Phrases extracted it is better to few visualisation on how it has been mention over a specified time, through some plotting. This gives a better understanding on our data for further sentimental analysis phases  
  - As a part of the bug listed in the ```issues``` tab, upload python script which plots your visualization upon different parameters.
  
- [ ] **As of from week3 no additional learning materials will be provided by us, we expect you to do some internet research like in stack overflow**
