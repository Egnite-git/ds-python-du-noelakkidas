- [ ] **Part 4.1: Sentiment Analysis**

  In this part, you'll need to implement the core of this project which is sentiment analysis. There are a bundle of open source library to help you in this process. Its very critical to feed an input data that doesn't contain any unwanted words and letters as it might affect the Sentiment score retrieved for the input. So a very keen pre-processing needs to be done before feeding the input. 
  Also, there are lot of ways to retrieve sentiment score for a sentence like, list of positive sentiments, a dictionary of positive, negative and neutral sentiments. Choose the approach which suits your method of popularity score analytics.
  - As a part of the bug listed in the ```issues``` tab, upload the python script you have written to do this automation, also upload the Sentiment scores you have obtained, in any file format.

  Popularity score is way of quantitatively scaling the Sentiment score upon a Key-Phrase throughout the given time, for visualisation example in years vs in months, etc. You choose either one or all sentiment score for popularity analysis.
